Must and Gailis pleaded guilty to all charges at an earlier hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the sentencing on Tuesday 26 March, His Honour Judge Picton said the plot to bring in the 1.4 tonnes of cocaine was an &quot;importation of the highest order&quot; (that would have come into the UK) and &quot;which would have resulted in appalling social harm&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of a National Crime Agency-led operation, SY Nomad was intercepted by the Border Force cutter Vigilant off the south coast of Cornwall on 29 August last year, having travelled from Suriname in South America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The operation was also supported by Devon and Cornwall Police, the Maritime Analysis &amp; Operations Centre (Narcotics) MAOC(N), the Irish Navy and the Irish Air Corps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yacht was escorted into Newlyn Harbour, where officers from the NCA and the Border Force Deep Rummage team boarded the vessel and searches began. They discovered more than 1,400 kilo blocks of cocaine hidden inside locked storage containers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three men on board &ndash; Must, Gailis and Dijkstra &ndash; were arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking offences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The estimated wholesale value of the cocaine was &pound;44,896,000, with an approximate street value once cut and adulterated of &pound;112 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nigel Clark and Dean Waters were arrested later that day by NCA officers who had been carrying out surveillance on them before the yacht&rsquo;s arrival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Waters had previously purchased a RHIB &ndash; Brenda&rsquo;s Pet &ndash; which he arranged to be transported from Spain to Bristol and onwards to Southampton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the 28 August, Waters towed the RHIB towards Cornwall, meeting up with Clark in Launceston before they all travelled in convoy to Hayle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following day Clark was observed in Hayle, waiting with the RHIB. Waters had purchased a GPS device, thermal cameras and other maritime equipment, including a repair kit for the RHIB and a solar charged portable inflator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Officers believed the plan was for the RHIB to meet the SY Nomad at sea and transfer the drugs over for onward distribution to the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After they were arrested, searches of vehicles owned by Clark and Waters resulted in the discovery of additional electronic devices. including encrypted mobile phones, the thermal camera and the GPS device Waters had purchased the previous day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A significant quantity of cash and a registration document for the SY Nomad in Clark&rsquo;s name was also found during the search. NCA Senior Investigating Officer Ty Surgeon said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This was an audacious plan to bring cocaine worth &pound;112 million to the UK by boat, and it was only thwarted through law enforcement and partner agencies working together, sharing intelligence and conducting operational activity to stop it.<br />\r\n&ldquo;The main instigators Clark and Waters, both of whom have previous convictions for drug trafficking offences, are professional drug smugglers. They knew exactly what they were doing and had planned every part of the attempt.<br />\r\n&ldquo;This case demonstrates our ability and ongoing determination to disrupt and prosecute the international criminal gangs attempting to smuggle drugs into the UK.&rdquo;<br />\r\nNCA Deputy Director Matt Horne said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This intelligence-led investigation resulted in the seizure of a significant quantity of cocaine that would have made its way to towns and cities across the UK.<br />\r\n&ldquo;Making a profit is the motive for organised criminals and this interdiction would have really hit them in the pocket &ndash; disrupting their activities and damaging their reputation at the same time.<br />\r\n&ldquo;We know there are links between drug supply and violent crime. This seizure, along with the two tonnes recovered in similar circumstances at the same harbour in July last year, demonstrate the NCA&rsquo;s role in helping to prevent that&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gordon Scarratt, Head of Border Force Maritime, said:<br />\r\n&ldquo;The Border Force cutter&rsquo;s interception of the yacht was a crucial intervention in this successful operation, leading to the search of the vessel, the discovery of a vast quantity of dangerous drugs and ultimately the men&rsquo;s arrests. Our maritime crews play a key role in patrolling the UK&rsquo;s coastline and intelligence sharing between law enforcement agencies ensures this is done to maximum effect.&rdquo;</p>\r\n',20,1,2434,7,NULL,NULL,'2019-03-27 11:27:01','2019','3','n',NULL,'2019-03-27 11:26:56','2019-03-27 21:25:57',1,1,NULL),(166687,'\"Is Paul Enenche really a Christian?

He&nbsp;lamented that the Force received less than 20 per cent of the N25billion capital budget for security outfits.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Adamu said: &ldquo;On my assumption of office as the Inspector-General of Police in January 2019, I began taking determined steps, drawing from national and international policing leadership experiences, to provide the highest possible level of professional and responsible leadership for the Nigeria Police to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness. However, at every turn, I am confronted with the issue of inadequate funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nigeria is a large country with a huge population and policing a nation as large and diverse as Nigeria requires enormous funding. Also, to maintain neutrality and avoid compromises in the performance of its statutory duties, the Nigeria Police Force should obtain its funding requirements from constitutionally recognised sources.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The Police boss also stressed that the meagre allocation to the force is grossly inadequate to meet the day-to-day running and need of every personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said: &ldquo;Presently, the Police depend on the government for the provision of funds for day-to-day operations. However, the annual budgetary allocation for the Force, especially with regards to capital and overhead costs, does not reflect the enormous size, scope of responsibility and actual needs of the Force.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Arising from the limitations of funding occasioned by the budgetary constraint, most of the requirements that would enable the Force to perform are never met. For instance, as against a capital budget estimate of N342.9billion proposed for the 2018 fiscal year, the Force was given an appropriation of N25.5billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Appropriations in respect of the overhead cost and capital budget to the Force over the years have failed to meet the funding requirements of the police.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of the committee condemned the low funding allocated to the Police in the 2019 proposed budget.

But I was surprised to see her that same Monday when she came with two boys to my room. I left her in my room with the two boys but when they called me some 30 minutes later, one of the guys brought out a gun and ordered me to kneel down while one of them was making love to Khadijat who was naked on my bed. Khadijat was begging them to leave and promising not to tell anyone about what happened but they strangulated her in the process and ordered me to go and bring digger and shovel.&nbsp; I thought they wanted to use that to escape from the scene of the incident but when I entered the room they were still there and ordered me to dig the grave where we buried her in my room and covered it with the rug. &rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked why he failed to alert her&nbsp;parents or tenants when he was ordered to look for the diggers, he said</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The tenants were busy watching World Cup match and the noise from the home theater in my room was too loud to make them know what was happening even when we were digging the grave in my room. The two boys left after burying her and I couldn&rsquo;t sleep in my room that day and I had to sleep in my brother&rsquo;s room because I wasn&rsquo;t myself and I couldn&rsquo;t tell anyone because no one will believe my story.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know the two guys, though they have visited my place thrice with Khadijat I don&rsquo;t know them or their names. I have been dating Khadijat since 2010, she was my girlfriend but I knew nothing about these guys, she invited them, I don&rsquo;t know their names but I can recognise them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>He denied killing Khadijat</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I did not kill Khadijat for money ritual, though I joined Yahoo business this year and never made any headway I don&rsquo;t plan to do any ritual&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Reacting to Adeyemi&#39;s claims, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Femi Joseph, dismissed it, saying his defence is infantile</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&#39;&#39;His defence is very infantile and does not hold any water and I am very sure in the next few hours he should begin to talk&rdquo;.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>On how the suspect was arrested, the police spokesperson said</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&#39;&#39;We met the suspect who happened to be the boyfriend to the late Khadijat, in his room trying to pack the remains in a sack and this is to tell you that he killed Khadijat.&nbsp;According to him, he mentioned some other suspects now at large but we found that he single-handedly looked for digger, shovel, dug a grave in his room and buried Khadijat.&nbsp;The Police immediately swooped on him, and on close observation of his residence, it was discovered that the suspect had actually buried the missing girl for six days and was planning to exhume the remains and finally dispose of them.&nbsp;According to him, he was not comfortable with the stench coming from the decomposed body as it was not properly buried&#39;&#39;.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n',9,1,6629,41,NULL,NULL,'2019-03-27 12:20:42','2019','3','Ondo state,Court,Akure,Ondo state High court',NULL,'2019-03-27 12:05:15','2019-03-27 21:26:52',1,1,NULL),(166695,'Former Manchester United boss, Jose Mourinho moves to \'coach either Lyon or Monaco\' in France\'s Ligue 1','former-manchester-united-boss-jose-mourinho-moves-to-coach-either-lyon-or-monaco-in-frances-ligue-1','<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Former Manchester United boss, Jose Mourinho \'eyes move to Lyon or Monaco\' in France\'s Ligue 1\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5c9b5a27ea193.jpg\" style=\"border:0px solid black; height:236px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; margin-top:0px; width:360px\" vspace=\"0\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former <strong>Manchester United</strong> boss, <strong>Jose Mourinho</strong> is reportedly planning a move to <strong>France </strong>for the next of his managerial career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Wednesday&#39;s edition of L&#39;Equipe, Mourinho who has been without a club since Manchester United sacked him in December, has identified either <strong>Lyon</strong> or <strong>Monaco </strong>as his preferred next destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5c9b5a5575758.jpg\" style=\"height:796px; width:634px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lyon are currently third in the Ligue 1 standings, 24 points behind leaders <strong>PSG</strong>, while Monaco are 16th in Ligue 1, eight points clear of the bottom three but L&#39;Equipe suggests it is unlikely Mourinho will head there as he shares the same agent as the coach of the club, <strong>Leonardo Jardim.</strong></p>\r\n',13,1,1728,9,NULL,NULL,'2019-03-27 12:18:35','2019','3','Manchester United,Jose Mourinho,France ,Lyon,Monaco ,PSG,Leonardo Jardim.',NULL,'2019-03-27 12:11:36','2019-03-27 21:26:20',1,1,NULL),(166696,'Girl, 13, set on fire by ex, 19, who was furious she ended their relationship','girl-13-set-on-fire-by-ex-19-who-was-furious-she-ended-their-relationship-2','<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5c9b5c5f2b51a.PNG\" style=\"height:354px; width:340px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A teenage girl is in a battle for her life after she was set on fire by her ex-boyfriend because she ended their relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 13-year-old girl suffered burns to almost 90 percent of her body&nbsp;after her 19-year-old ex poured gasoline on her body and set her on fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wilson Javier Mel&eacute;ndez Bonilla, 19, entered the girl&#39;s home in the southwestern Puerto Rican town of Cabo Rojo, on Saturday night, to find her asleep on the couch.

Reacting to this development, Kalu said</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I am a very loyal party man. The party has zoned the senate presidency position to the North-East and I want to respect the party&rsquo;s will but the second position is what we are not going to allow to leave the South-East.&nbsp; So, as far as I am concerned, in the South-East, I am going to run openly on the floor of the House for the position of Deputy Senate President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am not going to listen to the party neither will I listen to anybody. Nobody that wants to be the Deputy Senate President is more loyal than I am to the party.&nbsp;I have suffered for the party and have been called by Nigerians to come out. I want the party to respect the will of every other person and I am committed to democracy and contesting on the floor of the House.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking further, he said&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;So, if justice must prevail, you have to bring the Senate President from the North-East and you bring the Deputy Senate President to the South-East.&nbsp;The chairman of the party is from South-South. The President is from North-West. The Vice-President is from South-West and also the Senate President will come from North-East.&nbsp;Whether it is Senators Ahmed Lawal or Alli Ndume, this will be decided on the floor of the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So, for me, the tripod in Nigeria is Ibo, Yoruba and Hausa and we are going to get the deputy senate president and I will fight on the floor of the House like no other person has fought.&nbsp;That is not challenging the party but this is about looking for justice. Buhari said recently after the elections that he will be addressing issues of injustice and this is part of the issue&#39;&#39;.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>He further maintained that he was qualified for the position having being a former member of the Federal House of Representatives from 1991 to 1993 and also a two-time governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know the nook and crannies of how legislators operate. I have dealt with them and I am not a new comer. So, it is going to be impossible to edge me out or edge a whole zone out by claiming we are new comers.&nbsp;What I am fighting for is justice, fair play and for Nigeria to continue to be one. I have suffered in fighting for the unity of the country. They cannot use National Assembly or petty House officers to divide the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have sweated.

Those asking the tribunal to sack President Buhari and order a fresh election, are the Presidential candidate of the Hope Democratic Party, HDP, Chief Ambrose Owuru, whose petition marked as CA/ PEPC/001/2019, also cited the All Progressives Congress, APC and the INEC as Respondents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owuru secured a total of 1,663 in the presidential election. In another petition that was registered as CA/PEPC/004/2019, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Movement, PDM, Pastor Aminchi Habu, equally challenged the outcome of the presidential poll. Similarly, in its own petition marked CA/PEPC/003/2019, the Coalition For Change, C4C and its presidential candidate, Geff Chizee Ojinka, also urged the tribunal to nullify President Buhari&rsquo;s election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remarkably, unlike in all the other petitions, the C4C, which garnered a total of 2,391 votes at the presidential poll, cited the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, as the 2nd Respondent in its case. It told the tribunal that its candidate, Ojinka, was validly nominated to participate in the February 23 election in order to secure votes to occupy the presidential seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Petitioners contend that the above election was vitiated by substantial non compliance with mandatory statutory provisions, which irregularity substantially affected the election such that the 1st Respondent was not entitled to be returned as the Winner of the Presidential election&rdquo;, the party added.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The Justice Abdul Aboki led tribunal had on Wednesday, ordered that President Buhari should be served with a copy of the the petition marked as CA/ PEPC/002/2019, which was filed by the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tribunal directed that Buhari should be served with all the legal processes, through any senior officer at the APC National Secretariat in Abuja. Atiku and the PDP had applied to be allowed to serve the petition on Buhari via substituted means, decrying that retinue of security operatives at the Presidential Villa, made it impossible for them to effect personal service of the processes on him.</p>\r\n',12,1,2697,13,NULL,NULL,'2019-03-27 15:42:38','2019','3',' President Buhari?,victory,election,candidates',NULL,'2019-03-27 15:39:36','2019-03-27 21:27:22',1,1,NULL),(166722,'TomTom â Signs on Phyno and Teni as ambassadors ','tomtom-signs-on-phyno-and-teni-as-ambassadors','<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5c9b8a501abab.png\" style=\"height:158px; width:340px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TomTom is in the news doing big things, the candy brand that has provided soothing relief for millions of Nigerians over the years, recently announced that it will be adding excitement in the lives of millions more by engaging more as a candy that identifies with the new generation and redefines what it means to be cool, upbeat and stylish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To emphasize this, TomTom has signed on two leading Nigerian music acts as brand ambassadors &ndash; Fast rising multi-Talented Singer songwriter Teni and Leading international rap artiste Phyno.

They took their victim to a night club on the said day.&nbsp;While at a nightclub, the defendants allegedly spiked the complainant&rsquo;s drink with a substance that rendered her unconscious.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They allegedly took the complainant to George&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s hotel, raped her in turns while videotaping the sexual offence.&nbsp;According to the prosecution, the offences contravened Sections 258 and 409 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Counsel to the suspects, Mr Tunji Ayanlaja (SAN), via a March 12 summons for bail, applied for the defendants&rsquo; bail.&nbsp;He also noted that the prosecution had filed a counter-affidavit, objecting to the defendants bail application &ldquo;because of the social status of the defendants&rsquo; parents.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The defendants have been in custody since February 6.

This will not be enough to sway your lordship as special facts for your Lordship to hold that they be denied bail.&nbsp;There is nothing in the counter-affidavit that should be a clog in your lordship&rsquo;s discretion in admitting the boys to bail.&nbsp;The fathers of the boys are in court and they will ensure their attendance of proceedings.&rdquo; he said</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>But Martins, who confirmed that he had filed a counter-affidavit dated March 26, opposed him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He noted that the alleged offences were severe and attract a life sentence if the defendants are found guilty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to him, if George and Rasak are granted bail, there is high likelihood of them interfering with witnesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;On the issue of the character of the evidence, the alleged rape happened on Feb. 3 at Delankaster Hotels off Admiralty Way in Lekki.&nbsp;The victim (name withheld), is a 24-year-old young lady and the hotel belongs to the father of the first defendant, Don-Chima George.&nbsp;The lady is well known to the defendants and second defendant, in his statement, admitted to previously spending time in her house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;By virtue of the victim being well known to the defendants, there are strong indications that the victim will be interfered with.&nbsp;In an allegation of rape that the victim is well known to the defendant(s), there is a high likelihood of witness interference.&nbsp;This is a common experience of mine as a prosecutor of almost three decades.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An allegation of rape for a victim is bad enough, then the allegation of rape against two people well known to the victim, who gang-raped her is absolutely condemnable.&nbsp;I just want to reiterate that the two defendants will not answer the bail but will flee. There is also nothing relating to the health of the defendants that will warrant their need for bail.&nbsp;There is no life-threatening medical condition with which the defendants could justify the court&rsquo;s discretion being granted in their favour.&nbsp;There is also a video recording of the offence.

Don&rsquo;t forget that he is on suspension and as far as this party is concerned, that situation remains because there is no way we can say that somebody is on suspension and still go ahead to intervene in his case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In any case, he has not even come up to inform the party of his problem because he has realised that he is on suspension. Therefore, until it is vacated, the party will now step in to intervene as a party member who has a problem to resolve.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Onilu further dismissed insinuation that the open declaration for candidates of African Action Congress in Rivers state by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi amount to anti-party activities. He noted that the APC was precluded from contesting elections in Rivers by pronouncements of the Court. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said: &ldquo;On whether what Rotimi Amaechi did in Rivers governorship election amounted to anti-party activities, I will emphatically say no because if you liken it to the situation in Imo or Ogun states, it will be wrong. In Rivers State, APC does not have any candidate and as a party, Rivers State is very important to us. The state has been in the hands of pillagers for too long. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If we have the opportunity of working with a party willing to abide by our principles, then it is within our right to work with such a party to ensure we free the people of Rivers State from the locust. In this case, he has not abandoned a particular candidate that belongs to the APC for a candidate of another party. They are entirely different issues and in that case, there is no anti-party. Whatever Amaechi has done is completely normal and acceptable to this party as far as working with other party is concerned.&rdquo;</p>\r\n',12,1,933,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2019-03-27 20:51:39','2019','3','apc,rochas okorocha,under the bus,Certificate Of Return',NULL,'2019-03-27 20:37:04','2019-03-27 21:27:29',1,1,NULL),(166746,'\'This is the handiwork of the Buhari federal government\'Â  - Dokpesi says afterÂ Nigeria Immigration Service InterrogateÂ him at the airport','this-is-the-handiwork-of-the-buhari-federal-government-dokpesi-says-after-nigeria-immigration-service-interrogate-him-at-the-airport','<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\'This is the handiwork of the Buhari federal government\'Â  - Dokpesi says afterÂ Nigeria Immigration Service InterrogateÂ him at the airport\" src=\"https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5c9bd3f173074.JPG\" style=\"height:336px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chairman of DAAR Communications, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, was on Wednesday interrogated for about an hour at the national headquarters of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) over his international passport. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The media magnate had been arrested by security personnel believed to have been detailed from the Department of State Service at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja, on his return from medical check up abroad last Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Wednesday, the politician, who was again invited by the Immigration and was questioned at the Comptroller General&rsquo;s Investigation Department. He arrived there at 2.00pm and was released about an hour later after the interrogation. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emerging from the session, Dopkesi told reporters that Immigration Service demanded for his international passport which he said was in the custody of the Federal High Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below is a transcript of his reaction s published by AIT</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I just returned from a medical trip overseas last Friday, March 22, 2019, when I was arrested for 50 -55 minutes at the airport. I was told that they have instructions from above to arrest me on my return but after a few phone calls and contacts, the immigration officer at the airport told me that he has instructions from above that I can leave and he gave me back my passport and told me that I should go and that they will reach me subsequently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Monday, I received new information and in line with the normal process, I returned my passport to the Federal High Court since I travelled under&nbsp;judicial&nbsp;approval or permission. So I returned my passport and came back and gave notice that I might have to go for a medical check-up so that they will ensure that the operation was successful and that all the organs and everything&nbsp;is&nbsp;properly healed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when I got the letter yesterday the 26th, I replied that same yesterday the 26th notifying them that I have returned the passport to the Federal High Court and that it has been duly acknowledged and added all the necessary information and so on. But the officers who interrogated me said that they had expected me to go back to the Federal High Court and obtain the passport with their letter of invitation. I told them that I totally defer from that line of thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have returned, I got the passport from the Federal High Court. I returned the passport to the Federal High Court. If you the immigration service with the instruction from above require my passport then write directly to the Federal High Court and request for the passport. If you like, you can copy me for me to be able to go there and say, look I am supposed to be a courier, has the Court approved it and I will return it clearly, but that did not happen and that made us have altercations and tempers went very high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I stood my ground and said, well I am a Nigerian citizen, I have travelled out for my medical treatment. I am back to the country and I voluntarily came back and has handed over my passport to the appropriate authority. They were telling me that the passport was a property of the federal government and federal government has a right to withdraw it at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Granted the passport is a property of the federal government and federal government has a right to withdraw it but I am also a citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and there is a judicial process. There is a rule of law, why should we not go through the judicial process and be able to define what is required?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the situation of things now?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The resolution now is that of&nbsp;course, they said I should go home, but he left with an annotation that should they have any reason to invite me after they had reviewed my statement that I wrote and the letter I sent to them yesterday, that I should honour the invitation when I do receive it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there any indication that they want to impound your passport?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definitely, if I had brought my passport today, they would have impounded it, that is what it is. There are no two ways about it but the passport is with the Court. But even if they decide to do so, like I said the passport is a property of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, so they can request for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you suspect any foul play?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not suspect any foul play, I can only say what I know but&nbsp;honestly, this is the handiwork of the Buhari federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What actions are you going to take now?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly, there is nothing I can do, I am already in court, we have challenged Order 6 and all the Orders that are there, I am a citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and it is through my own sweat that I went for treatment.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n',12,1,377,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2019-03-27 20:56:22','2019','3','buhari,dokpesi,handiwork,Nigeria Immigration Service',NULL,'2019-03-27 20:51:22','2019-03-27 21:27:26',1,1,NULL),(166747,'Photos: Many injured, some fearef dead as tanker collides with bus in Anambra','photos-many-injured-some-fearef-dead-as-tanker-collides-with-bus-in-anambra','<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5c9b8e9fcce5c.jpg\" style=\"height:255px; width:340px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">A tanker loaded with fuel collided with a bus carrying passengers along the Amansea Agu-Awka road, Awka.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">The accident happened early this morning at about 2am.</div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">Eyewitnesses report that several people were injured and some also feared dead as a result of the accident.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">Men of the Anambra State Fire Service, security agencies, road traffic officials were seen at the scene trying to manage the situation.</div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"auto\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5c9bd4534bb3c.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:480px\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"auto\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5c9bd46b9dea8.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:480px\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n',20,1,210,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2019-03-27 20:52:50','2019','3','n',NULL,'2019-03-27 20:52:36','2019-03-27 21:26:14',1,1,NULL),(166748,' Photo: Mother of seven shot dead by a disgruntled man in front of church in Ebonyi','photo-mother-of-seven-shot-dead-by-a-disgruntled-man-in-front-of-church-in-ebonyi','<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5c9bd540b02e1.jpg\" style=\"height:212px; width:340px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Police have arrested a man, who&nbsp;shot dead a 50-year-old woman in front of a new generation church&nbsp; in Amasiri, Afikpo North local government area of Ebonyi State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deceased identified as Chinyere Agwu, a mother of seven, was at the Solution Ground International Church, Amasiri, in the company of two other women for an intercessory prayer at about 5 a.m. when she was shot by the gunman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Premium Times, the women were said to have spotted a man they identified as Paul with their torchlight,&nbsp; holding something in his hands which they could not see very well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As they made to enter the church, he began shooting sporadically in their direction.<br />\r\nMrs Agwu was hit by some bullets while a bullet grazed the shoulder of another woman before the gunman took to his heels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The general overseer of the church, Michael Uche, told PREMIUM TIMES that he was alerted by the cry of his mother who was one of the victims.
